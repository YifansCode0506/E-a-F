    <!-- 常见问题 Section -->
    <section class="faq-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Common problems in selecting services</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">Q1: Do the service personnel have experience? Have you done similar work before?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Answer: Although I am not professionals trained by institutions, I have rich experience in actually taking care of loved ones, accompanying pets, and organizing families. If you are willing, I can provide a trial service first, and it is more important for you to personally experience it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">Q2: Can you ensure the privacy and security of your family?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Answer: I attach great importance to the trust of our customers, and I always adhere to the agreed time and content for each service. I will never look through, take photos, or handle customer items without permission.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">Q3: What are the charges? Is there a clear price?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Answer: My service prices are very transparent, charged by the hour (such as XX dollars per hour), or you can choose a package form (such as "3-hour Shopping +3-hour Companion Service").
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">Q4: Can I call you over temporarily? Do you have an emergency appointment?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Answer: If time permits, I am willing to accept last-minute appointments, especially when elderly people or pets need help in emergency situations.
                I suggest you confirm the recent schedule with me in advance, or reserve an "emergency service period" for regular customers to prevent unexpected events.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="question">Q5: How do you know what you have done during the service process? What should I do when I'm not at home?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
                Answer: I can briefly report the service situation to you via SMS, WhatsApp, or other means after each service (such as "The old gentleman had lunch today and his temperature is normal").
                You can also propose the key content you wish to record, and I will cooperate to complete it.
